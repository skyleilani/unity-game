# Fractal Explorer

Fractal Explorer based on Mandelbrot set. Rather than navigating using WASD, this is connected to my arduino circuit and controlled with buttons that are currently a work in progress. 

Base setup currently has two basic buttons. If possible, I'll use conductive paint in the future but seeing what I can do with what I have here instead.
